The remaining ARIA issues (role, aria-live, aria-label on dismiss button, pause-on-hover) are JavaScript/HTML concerns that cannot be validated from CSS alone -- these are noted but not Workshop CSS blockers. Alternative for pause-on-hover: a CSS-only approach could use .t-toast:hover and .t-toast:focus-within to extend animation-duration, but the real solution requires JS timer management.","feedback":"Reduced motion support is properly implemented.
